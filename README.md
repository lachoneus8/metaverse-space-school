## Project Description

When was the last time you looked up at the sky, at the moon and stars, and watched how they shine for you? Do you remember the first time you learned that there are other planets in this world that are far, far away and started wondering how they look and feel up close instead of just looking at boring images on a piece of paper?

Imagine waking up in a classroom filled with only 2D posters, and moments later, you find yourself exploring the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. Two CONTRASTING worlds indeed. That's exactly what happens in this incredible VR experience. Meet Andy, a student who gets transported to the far reaches of the galaxy to study astronomy. From landing on the moon to analyzing rocks on Mars, Andy takes FULL CONTROL of his learning experiences, and so can you.

Research has found that experiencing visceral reactions to what we are experiencing are fundamental to forming memories. What weâ€™ve built is only a stepping stone to a platform of VR learning in education. By leveraging the full potential of VR technology, we can create highly memorable experiences that keep students engaged throughout their learning journey. This platform can be used not only for space exploration but also for a range of subjects including biology, chemistry, math, and more, making the possibilities for learning truly limitless.

## Note on source control

We used Plastic SCM for our source repository, but didn't realize until after we started that we couldn't make that repo public.  Here is our commit history:
